# Location Blog

## Purpose of this site

This site has been created so that users can share and seek information about places to visit.  
Unregistered users can view a summary of the posts, to get a flavour of what the site does.  
Registered users can create posts, edit and delete their own posts.  They can also comment and like other peoples posts.

## User Experience


### User Goals


#### First Time User would like to:
- find out the purpose of the site and how to use it
- be able to easily navigate throughout the site
- see a list of posts to see if the site is something they would be interested in
- be able to register for a user account

#### Registered User would like to:
- be able to sign into my user account
- view posts and leave comments and likes
- create their own post
- edit and delete their own posts only
- be able to logout of my account to keep my account safe

#### Site Owner would like to:
- restrict access to non-registered users
- control users posts and comments for inappropriate use of the site. I have decided not to put in approval by superuser for adding posts and adding comments but instead have put a warning that the site admin will remove anything that is not in keeping with the sites ethos.

### Agile Development Tool


I am using an agile software development tool in the development of this website.  I am using Github projects, using a basic Kanban template.  I added automation so that as each new issue is added it adds it to the 'To Do' list for my project.  As I start working on each issue I move it to the 'In progress' column.  When the coding for each issues has been completed, the issue is then moved to the 'done' column.


## Existing Features

### Navbar and footer

#### Navbar

- Links to Home, post list, register and sign in/out pages. The home and post list pages are visible to and can be accessed by any user.  If the user is not signed in, the sign in and register links are visible on the navbar. If the user is signed in then there is a sign out link visible.  Also if the user is signed in there is a message to say user name is currently signed in, to act as an extra visual to the user that they are signed in! The active link is highlighted so that the user can see easily what page they are on.

## super user

I created a superuser so that they can create, read, update and delete posts so that they can manage the blogs content.

## Design

The design is kept simple to let the location posts take centre stage.  Also to make it easy for users to navigate the site.

| | updated_date | DateTime
| | content | TextField
| | featured_image | Cloudinary_image
| | excerpt | TextField
| many-to-many | likes | User Model
| label for url | slug (unique) | slugfield

#### Comment model

| Key | Name | Type
|--------|----------------|-------------------|
|foreign key | post | Post Model
| | name | Char(80)
| | body | TextField
| | created_on | DateTime

## Deployment

### deployment to heroku
Initial deployment
I followed the 'I think therefore I blog' walkthrough to create a basic django project.  I used the code institute template. 
- I installed django and supporting libraries
- I created a new django project called 'codeloco' and a django app called 'blog'
- I set the project to use Cloudinary and PostgreSQL
- I deployed the empty project to heroku

### Forking the Github repository
By forking the GitHub Repository you will be able to make a copy of the original repository on your own GitHub account allowing you to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps:

- Log in to GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository
- At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" button on the menu, locate the "Fork" button.
- You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.

### Making a local clone
- Log in to GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository
- Under the repository name, click "Clone or download".
- To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", copy the link.
- Open commandline interface on your computer
- Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
- Type git clone, and then paste the URL you copied above.
- Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.
